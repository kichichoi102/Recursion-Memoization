# Recursion-Memoization
Taking common recursion algorithms and memoizing it to greatly improve the efficiency

# Dynamic Programming
Dynamic Programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions using a memory-based data structure (array, map,etc).
In these examples, I used an empty dictionary to store the key-value pairs which correspond to their respective index and their solution.

# 1. Fibbonacci Sequence
The Fibbonacci sequence can be made dynamic by adding the previous two numbers in the sequence together
